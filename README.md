# Entracer_device
This is the code for the Entracer Project. This code has to be uploaded on the Raspberry Pi controlling the device.

When connected with Wi-Fi network and all the required modules, this code will scan the ID card, measure Oxygen Level and Temperature of the person in front in the respective order. 

Then it will report the readings on an LCD Screen and also upload them to Google Firebase used to manage the App and Real time tracking feature.
